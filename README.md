# FWS Speed Grader
This is a light web application (with Google Colab) that generates written comments based on customized grading rubrics. To run the application, select the "speed_grader.ipynb" file and click "Open in Colab." Run the cell and follow its instructions.

## File List

* grading_rubric.csv </br>
This is the grading rubric in csv format.

## Crowdsourcing Rubrics
If you are using writing rubrics and/or have a repository of common student writing issues, we can crowdsource these contents to improve and customize the tool for your class. Use "grading_rubric.csv" and "writing_issue.csv" files as examples.
